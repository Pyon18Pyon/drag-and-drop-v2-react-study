# drag-and-drop-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I re-wrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [drag-and-drop-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/drag-and-drop-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This is called **Kanban Board**, keeping track of all tasks we have.
This board is divided into different columns. The items or tasks in each column moves in between columns, and it can be edited. We can also add more items on the board and delete those items as well.

## Key features

- Use of the drag and drop API. It allows us to move any HTML file element and drop it inside of any other HTML element.
- Use of localStorage functionality.
- Uses content editable attributes in order to add and modify items.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
